### Feed Forward Neural Networks

In this project, in the first part, we will implement a Feed Forward Neural Network from scratch, using the NumPy library. In the second part, with the help of the codes of the first part, we will train some neural networks and we will examine the effect of some parameters in the learning process.

In this exercise we work with part of the `Cifar-10` dataset. The dataset contains images of 10 different classes, but we'll use cats and horses.
